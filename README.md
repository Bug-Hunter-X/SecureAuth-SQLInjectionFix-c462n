This repository demonstrates a common SQL injection vulnerability and its solution. The `bug.sql` file shows a vulnerable query that directly uses user input without sanitization. This makes the application susceptible to attacks where malicious users can inject arbitrary SQL code to manipulate the database.  The `bugSolution.sql` file shows the corrected query using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
